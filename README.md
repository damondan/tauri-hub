# ðŸš€ Tauri Hub

A desktop application management center built with Tauri, SvelteKit, and Tailwind CSS. Tauri Hub allows you to register, manage, and launch multiple Tauri applications from a centralized dashboard.

## Features

- ðŸ“± **App Registry**: Register and manage multiple Tauri applications
- ðŸš€ **Launch Control**: Start and stop applications directly from the hub
- ðŸ’Ž **Beautiful UI**: Modern gradient interface with glassmorphism effects
- ðŸ“Š **Status Monitoring**: Real-time status tracking for all registered apps
- âš¡ **Fast & Lightweight**: Built with Tauri for optimal performance

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Rust (Tauri)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

cargo tauri build
```

## Usage

1. **Adding Applications**: Click the "Add Application" button and fill in:
   - Name: Display name for your app
   - Description: Brief description of the app
   - Path: Directory path where the app is located
   - Executable: Path to the app's executable file

## Architecture

Tauri Hub follows a microservices architecture where:

- Each registered app runs as an independent process
- Apps can optionally share data through the hub's coordination layer
- Process lifecycle is managed by the hub's Rust backend
